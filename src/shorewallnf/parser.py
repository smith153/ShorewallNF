"""Parser — turns a preprocessed line stream into structured field-records.

The first pure-core parsing stage (ADR-0003): it consumes the preprocessor's
:class:`~shorewallnf.preprocessor.SourceLine` stream and yields nftables-agnostic
:class:`Record`\\ s — a line's whitespace/column-split fields tagged with the source
location the following stages report errors against. It handles the lexical concerns common
to every Shorewall tabular file (``#`` comments, blank lines, trailing-``\\`` continuation);
per-file *meaning* (which column is a zone, a proto, …) belongs to the per-file parsers built
on top of this. Malformed input fails fast with :class:`~shorewallnf.errors.ConfigError`.
