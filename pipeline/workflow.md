# Pipeline workflow

ShorewallNF is built by a pipeline of AI agents coordinated through GitHub. Work flows
through two phases: an upstream **Refinement** phase that grooms ideas into well-formed,
`implementation-ready` tasks, then a standard GitHub **Delivery** phase that turns tasks
into merged code.

Labels ([`labels.md`](labels.md)) describe an item's type/status; native GitHub state
(issues, PRs, CI) carries the rest. Review **verdicts** are the exception — a single shared
account can't cast `--approve`/`--request-changes` on its own PR, so review state rides on
`status:*` labels, not GitHub reviews.

## Roles

**Refinement**
1. **Epic Author** — surveys project state and proposes epics.
2. **Epic Decomposer** — breaks an approved epic into ordered, testable tasks.
3. **Task Groomer** — validates proposed tasks and gates them to `implementation-ready`.

**Delivery**
4. **Implementer** — implements one task via TDD and opens a PR.
5. **Code Reviewer** — reviews open PRs (cannot authorize merge).
6. **Fixer** — addresses requested changes on a PR.
7. **Merge-readiness** — flags approved + green PRs for a human to merge.

## Lifecycle

```
Epic Author ─► epic:proposed ─►(human approve)─► Decomposer ─► task:proposed
     ─► Groomer ──(≤2 rounds)──► implementation-ready
     ─► Implementer (assignee + in-progress) ─► PR (Closes #N) ─► in-review
     ─► Code Reviewer ─► review-passed  (issues → changes-requested ⇄ Fixer → in-review)
     ─► Merge-readiness (review-passed + green CI) ─► ready-to-merge ─►(human merge)─► closed
```

## Status transitions

| Status | Meaning | Applied by | Moves next when |
|--------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| `status:proposed` | Awaiting refinement/approval | Epic Author (epics), Decomposer (tasks) | Human approves epic / Groomer accepts task |
| `status:needs-refinement` | Groomer requested changes | Task Groomer | Decomposer/author revises → back to `proposed` |
| `status:implementation-ready` | Groomed & startable (epics: approved for decomposition) | Human (epics), Task Groomer (tasks) | Implementer claims it |
| `status:in-progress` | Claimed by an implementer | Implementer (with self-assign) | PR opened; or reclaimed to `implementation-ready` if the claim goes stale (Merge-readiness) |
| `status:blocked` | Has unmet dependencies (`blocked-by`) | Decomposer/Groomer | All blockers closed → Merge-readiness un-block sweep clears it |
| `status:in-review` | Has an open PR awaiting (re-)review | Implementer / Fixer | Reviewer sets `review-passed` or `changes-requested` |
| `status:changes-requested` | Reviewer found blocking issues | Code Reviewer | Fixer pushes a fix → back to `in-review` |
| `status:review-passed` | AI review clean; awaiting human merge | Code Reviewer | Merge-readiness sets `ready-to-merge` (CI green, up to date, review still current); new commits → back to `in-review` |
| `status:ready-to-merge` | Approved + green; awaiting human merge | Merge-readiness | Human merges |

## Status label invariants

- **One status at a time.** A task carries exactly one `status:*` label, optionally plus
  `status:blocked`; an epic being decomposed also carries a transient `status:decomposing`
  claim. Each role **swaps** the label — removing the prior status as it adds the
  next — rather than accumulating: claim = −`implementation-ready` +`in-progress`; PR opened =
  −`in-progress` +`in-review`; review clean = −`in-review` +`review-passed`; review found issues =
  −`in-review` +`changes-requested`; fix pushed = −`changes-requested` +`in-review`; commits after
  review = −`review-passed` +`in-review`; merge-ready = −`review-passed` +`ready-to-merge`. Merging
  closes the issue, so its final `status:*` is moot.
- **Un-blocking.** When a blocker's PR merges (its issue closes), the Merge-readiness un-block
  sweep removes `status:blocked` from each dependent once **all** its `blocked-by` blockers are
  closed, returning it to the queue.

## Collision avoidance

Volunteers run agents concurrently (often overnight), so claiming must be atomic:

- An agent **claims a task by self-assigning AND adding `status:in-progress`** in the same step.
- Agents only pick tasks that are **unassigned**, `status:implementation-ready`, and **not**
  `status:blocked`.
- The **Epic Decomposer** claims an epic with `status:decomposing` before decomposing it (and
  skips epics that already carry it), so two decomposers can't duplicate the same epic.
- One task per PR; one PR per branch. **All code work happens in a per-task git worktree —
  never in the primary checkout or on `master`** (that isolation is what lets agents run
  concurrently).

## Human gates

Only two human interventions are required; everything between them is autonomous.

1. **Epic approval (direction).** A human approves an epic by removing `status:proposed`
   and adding `status:implementation-ready` to the `type:epic` issue. The Decomposer only
   picks up epics in that approved state.
2. **Merge (final look).** Branch protection on `master` requires green CI **and** a human
   approving review (via [`CODEOWNERS`](../.github/CODEOWNERS)). The AI Code Reviewer never
   casts a GitHub review verdict — it signals its verdict with `status:*` labels — so it can
   never satisfy this gate.

## Escalation

The Refinement churn is bounded. The Task Groomer allows at most **2 rounds** of
request-changes on a task; if it still isn't right, the Groomer adds `needs-human` and
stops, leaving the decision to a maintainer. Any agent that is uncertain or blocked on a
judgment call should add `needs-human` rather than guess.
